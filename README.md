# Micro speech example for TensorFlow Lite

The program analyzes an audio input with a voice recognition model that can detect 2 keywords - **yes** and **no**. The recognized keywords are then printed into a serial interface. The voice recognition model is implemented using [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers). 

The example project can be executed on Arm Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) as well as on hardware targets.

## Micro speech for FVP (Fixed Virtual Platform) for Corstone SSE-300 with Ethos-U55

Project directory: `./Platform_FVP_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55/`

This example executes the program on Corstone SSE-300 with Ethos-U55 Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs).

Example project has the following targets:
 - `Example`: target runs on FVP **with [**Virtual Streaming Interface (VSI)**](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/simulation/html/group__arm__vsi.html)**
    - Uses special Corstone SSE-300 Ethos-U55 FVP with VSI support<br>
      It is required to install the model executable and binaries in order to run this example.<br/>
      Expected installation directory on Windows: `C:\Program Files\Arm\VHT\models\Win64_VC2019`<br/>
      If installed in a different directory then this needs to be reflected:
        - in uVision project (Options for Target - Debug - Settings for Models Armv8-M Debugger) when running with MDK or
        - in script `run_example.cmd` when running standalone
    - Audio test data is provided by Python script `./VSI/audio/python/arm_vsi0.py` from WAVE file `test.wav` which contains keywords 'Yes' and 'No' alternating three times.
    - Open the example with Keil MDK (Windows only) using the uVision project `microspeech.uvprojx` and build it for target `Example`.
    - Alternatively compile with CMSIS-Build using `microspeech.Example.cprj` project.
    - Run example from the uVision project or standalone with script `run_example.cmd`.
    - When running the example the audio data input is processed and detected keywords are output to the Telnet terminal with their time stamps in the audio stream. Following output can be observed for the default test.wav file included with the example:
      ```
      Heard yes (152) @1100ms
      Heard no (141) @5500ms
      Heard yes (147) @9100ms
      Heard no (148) @13600ms
      Heard yes (147) @17100ms
      Heard no (148) @21600ms
      ```
 - `Example Test`: internal test for Example target
 - `Audio Provider Mock`: runs on FVP **without VSI support**
    - Uses [**ecosystem FVP for Corstone-300 MPS3**](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/arm-platforms-software/arm-ecosystem-fvps).<br>
      Expected installation directory on Windows `C:\Program Files\ARM\FVP_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55\models\Win64_VC2017\FVP_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55.exe`<br>
      If installed in a different directory then this needs to be reflected:
        - in uVision project (Options for Target - Debug - Settings for Models Armv8-M Debugger) when running with MDK or
        - in script run_example.cmd when running standalone
    - Audio test data is embedded in the test code and contains keywords 'Yes' and 'No' alternating indefinitely.
    - Open the example with Keil MDK (Windows only) using the uVision project `microspeech.uvprojx` and build it for target `Audio Provider Mock`.
    - Alternatively compile with CMSIS-Build using `microspeech.Audio_Provider_Mock.cprj` project.
    - Run example from the uVision project or standalone with script `run_audio_provider_mock.cmd`.
    - When running the example the audio data input is processed and detected keywords are continuously output to the Telnet terminal with their time stamps in the audio stream. Following output can be observed for the default test.wav file included with the example:
      ```
      Heard silence (149) @400ms
      Heard yes (158) @1200ms
      Heard no (143) @5600ms
      Heard yes (149) @9100ms
      Heard no (142) @13600ms

## TensorFlow-Lite kernel variants

The micro speech example uses [**tensorflow-lite-micro**]() pack that contains **Machine Learning** software component implementing among others the universal kernel for executing TensorFlow ML operations independent from the actual load type (audio, video, or others).

Implementation of these kernel operations is available in several variants optimized for Arm targets. When using the uVision project the variant can be selected in **Manage Run-Time Environment** window as shown on the picture below.

![TF-Lite Kernel component variants](./images/mdk_tf_kernel_variants.png "TF-Lite Kernel component variants")

When using CMSIS-Build the kernel variant is specified in the .cprj project file in the line:
```
    <component Cclass="Machine Learning" Cgroup="TensorFlow" Csub="Kernel" Cvariant="CMSIS-NN" Cvendor="tensorflow"/>
```
Following kernel variants are available:
- **CMSIS-NN**<br>Optimizes execution on Cortex-M devices by using mathematical functions from [CMSIS-NN software library](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/NN/html/index.html).<br>
Underlying implementations automatically utilize target-specific hardware extensions such as [**Helium**](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets/simd-isas/helium) (or 
MVE: M-Profile Vector Extensions) and [**SIMD**](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets/dsp-extensions/dsp-for-cortex-m) (Single Instruction Multiple Data) and so maximize computing performance and reduce code footprint.<br>
For devices with MVE (such as Cortex-M55), there is additional configuration field **Vector Extensions** in the **Options for Target..**-[**Target**](https://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/uv4/uv4_dg_adstarg.htm) dialog, that specifies MVE use in the project.
<br>

![MVE configuration in uVision](./images/mdk_conf_mve.png "MVE configuration in uVision project")

- **Ethos-U**<br>(Not functional at this moment). Uses implementation optimized for Arm Ethos-U NPUs.

- **Reference**<br>Target-independent software implementation is used. Fallback solution for operations that cannot be optimized for target hardware.

## Performance measurement with Event Statistics

File `./micro_speech/src/main_functions.cc` in the repository example contains [Event Statistics](https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/compiler/EventRecorder/html/es_use.html) annotations that allow to measure performance of ML algorithms in different configurations. This currently works only in setup with Keil MDK. [This video](https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/videos/KeilMDK/yDBbd3lQehXV.mp4) demonstrates program execution including the views into Event Statistics.

There are three events defined:
- **Event C0**: signal processing part that creates a spectrogram from the current data slice.

- **Event C1**: ML inference algorithm for the created spectrogram. Most compute-intensive part.

- **Event C2**: Verifies if a keyword was detected.

After executing the program with different TF-Lite kernel variants it can be observed that implementations optimized for Arm hardware extensions achieve significantly better performance for ML inference (C1 measurement), but also have shorter times for signal processing (C0 event).
